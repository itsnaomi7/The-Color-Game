# The-Color-Game

Can you guessa a color based off the hex/rgb code? This game challenges your knowledge of colors.

# Motivation

When I was in college studying Graphic Design, I used to be able to memorisesome hex code colors because I saw them so often. I thought it would be cool to make a memory game and see if I can still recognize colors and matxh them to code. 

# Tech used

HTML, CSS, Javascript.

# Installation Instruction:

copy and paste this to browser: https://itsnaomi7.github.io/The-Color-Game/

# How to play

Just click one of the color shapes you think matches the codeon screen, BEFORE the time runs out! 

# Unresolved challenges:

- I wanted to incorperate the snake game somewhat, and make the squares move around to make it a little harder. But when I tried to combine the ideas, the code wouldn't work right for the shapes. 
- Can't figure out how to connect timer to a message. 
- Wanted to give 2 chances to win but couldn't get the code to work without ruining colors.
